# Winfetch Configuration

This repository contains my configuration for [Winfetch](https://github.com/kiedtl/winfetch), a command-line system information tool for Windows, similar to Neofetch. Winfetch displays system information in a visually appealing way.

## Features

- **Customized System Info Display**: Shows essential system information such as OS, RAM, CPU, GPU, shell, and more.
- **Custom Color Scheme**: Personalized color setup for improved aesthetics.
- **Detailed Hardware Stats**: Enhanced output to showcase system details for easy reference.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ka1Thakkar/winfetch-config.git
2. Copy the configuration files into your Winfetch directory:
    - On Windows, this is typically located in the same directory where Winfetch is installed or in your PowerShell profile directory.
3. Run Winfetch to see the customized output:
  ```bash
  winfetch
  ```

## Customization
You can edit the configuration file to further personalize the system info displayed. Refer to the Winfetch documentation for more customization options.
